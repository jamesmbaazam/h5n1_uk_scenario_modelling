## Model Structure and Design

We implemented a stochastic branching process model to simulate international disease spread between the US (origin) and UK (destination). Each simulation began with a single infected case in the US. The number of secondary cases produced by each infected individual was drawn from a negative binomial distribution with mean equal to the reproduction number (R₀=2.0) and dispersion parameter (k=1000). This parameterisation created relatively homogeneous transmission patterns, with limited superspreading events. The timing between successive cases followed a lognormal serial interval distribution fitted to non-zoonotic transmission data. Each transmission chain evolved independently, with subsequent infections occurring according to these parameters.

Throughout the simulation, each infected individual had a daily probability of international travel to the UK. This probability was derived from annual US-UK visitor numbers (5.12M visitors/year) and US population data (334.2M). The model tracked both domestic transmission within the US and any new transmission chains initiated in the UK by infected travellers. Cases who travelled could seed new transmission chains in the UK, which then followed the same transmission parameters as the US chains. We ran 10,000 independent transmission chains for 1000 days each to capture the stochastic nature of both transmission and travel events, ensuring robust estimates of outbreak probabilities.

## Intervention Scenarios and Implementation

We tested different intervention strategies starting at days 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 after the initial case. The timing of implementation was crucial, as later starts allowed more cases to seed in the UK before controls began. Early intervention had the potential to prevent or delay establishment of transmission chains in the UK, while later implementation faced the challenge of controlling already established outbreaks. The range of start dates allowed us to quantify how the effectiveness of interventions degraded with delayed implementation.

The intervention scenarios comprised:

1. Pre-flight testing only: Passengers were tested before departure with time-dependent test sensitivity. Positive cases were prevented from travelling. Test sensitivity varied according to time since infection, reflecting the biological window period of detectability.

2. Post-arrival testing only: Arriving passengers were tested and positive cases entered quarantine. The quarantine period lasted 14 days.

3. Combined pre-flight and post-arrival testing: Both testing stages were implemented, maximising the chance of case detection. This scenario represented the most comprehensive control strategy but required the most resources to implement.

Each testing stage incorporated realistic features including time-dependent test sensitivity, delays in receiving results, and imperfect compliance. Implementation delays accounted for the time needed to establish testing infrastructure and train personnel.

## Analysis Methods and Metrics

For each scenario, we calculated multiple metrics to assess intervention effectiveness. The time to reach defined case thresholds (10 and 100 cases) indicated the speed of outbreak growth under different controls. Outbreak probabilities quantified the likelihood of established transmission in the UK, while risk reduction compared to no interventions provided a direct measure of intervention impact. These metrics were calculated for each intervention scenario and timing.

We employed survival analysis methods for time-to-threshold metrics, generating restricted mean survival times and confidence intervals. This approach accounted for right-censoring in the data when outbreaks had not reached the threshold by the end of the simulation period. We used Kaplan-Meier estimators to construct survival curves and Cox proportional hazards models to compare different intervention scenarios.

Results were visualised through multiple complementary approaches:

- Transmission chain plots showing individual outbreak trajectories, highlighting the stochastic nature of the process
- Epidemic curves displaying average case counts with uncertainty bounds derived from the simulation ensemble
- Survival curves for time-to-threshold analyses, showing the probability of remaining below threshold over time
- Heat maps showing outbreak probabilities under different intervention scenarios and implementation timings

All analyses were performed in R using the survival package for time-to-event analyses and ggplot2 for visualisation. Sensitivity analyses examined the impact of varying key parameters including R₀, dispersion parameter, and travel rates, ensuring our findings were robust to parameter uncertainty.
